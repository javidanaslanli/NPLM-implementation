# Neural Probabilistic Language Model
This repo contains the implementation of "Neural Probabilistic Language Model" paper. I tried to implement this paper both in torch and jax, so it could be useful for both community. 
The dataset I used is in Azerbaijani language and I tried to do word level implementation like they did in the paper. I tested different hyperparameters (it is sad i cannot share with you because somehow i delete that notebooks)
I used only a part of the data so it was really hard to achieve good results (dataset was not the best either) so I decided to only share implementation.

I leave the link to the paper here: https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf
